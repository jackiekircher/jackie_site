    Another game entry for <a href="http://octojam.com/octojam-ii">Octo-ber Jam</a>. I stuck to my puzzle game roots a little bit but this time I tried a more timing/mastery approach. Play as a hungry octopus and control their multiple tentacles simultaneously to grab food. Be careful not to get tangled up! I really enjoyed experimenting with the SuperChip instruction set. Play it <a href="http://octojam.com/octojam-ii/games/octovore">here</a>.

  %p
    My entry for <a href="http://octojam.com/octojam-i">Octo-ber Jam 2014</a>, this is a puzzle game about a ghost who is trying to make friends. Unfortunately, all of the people run away in fright. I had a fun time diving into Chip8 assembly to write this. You can play it through the Octo emulator <a href="http://octojam.com/octojam-i/games/glitch-ghost">here</a>.

  %p
    Basic Vim syntax highlighting and indentation rules for Chip8 assembly. I wrote these rules to make working on glitch ghost a lot less painful, but this was my first time writing vim plugins so they're mostly just pulled together from examples. They are also available <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5036">on vim.org</a>.

    A (mostly) weekly comic that I make that combines two of my favorite things - Starcraft and cat pictures. Zerglings doing things that cats do. What more is there to say?

  %p
    This is just a playful little project that I started to experiment with L-systems. It uses a few hueristics to generate drawing rules to create unnatural but still tree-like structures. <a href="/projects/l-systems">See it in action here</a>.

  %p
    A small set of animations based on poi and sacred geometry, written purely with CSS3. The goal of this was purely educational but some of the results are pretty mesmerizing. Inspired by this <a href="http://arqex.com/934/4-balls-10-spinners-css3-animations">CSS3 spinners</a> blog post. <a href="/projects/css3-animations">See them demoed here</a>.

  %p
    A very simple sprite-file animation tool for previewing sprite files. I wanted the ability to be able to edit individual frames in a sprite image and quickly see the impact it had on a moving sprite without having to rebuild the file.

  %p
    Specorgi is a mod for Spelunky HD by Mossmouth that replaces the pug damsel with a corgi (because corgis are cuter). I tried to stay as true to the original art style as I could.

    A city building simulation game made for OSGCC 5 with Andrea Della Corte and <a href="http://joannadrummond.com/">Joanna Drummond</a>, given the themes "mars" and "coins". It is an open-ended resource balancing game about pioneering a colony on Mars. I primarily worked on the Vim-Ruby connection and rendering engine.

    A DDR-based game made for OSGCC 4 with my teammates <a href="http://rarlindseysmash.com/">Lindsey Bieda</a> and James Larkby-Lahet. Our selected themes were "narwhals" and "corn". My major contributions were to graphics and group management. Be fast on your fingers and get ready to groove!
