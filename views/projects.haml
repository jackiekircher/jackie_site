      A (mostly) weekly comic that I make that combines two of my favorite things - Starcraft and cat pictures. Zerglings doing things that cats do. What more is there to say?

      A small set of animations based on poi and sacred geometry, written purely with CCS3. The goal of this was purely educational but some of the results are pretty mesmerizing. Inspired by this <a href="http://arqex.com/934/4-balls-10-spinners-css3-animations">CSS3 spinners</a> blog post. <a href="/projects/css3-animations">See them demoed here</a>.

      A very simple sprite-file animation tool for previewing sprite files. I wanted the ability to be able to edit individual frames in a sprite image and quickly see the impact it had on a moving sprite without having to rebuild the file.
